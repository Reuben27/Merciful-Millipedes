# Merciful Millipedes</br>
Repository for our submission to Python Discord Summer Code Jam 2021. Theme:- Think Inside the Box</br>
## Description
With the steady decline of the old newspaper on paper and an increasing dependence on online
news and media, we have often forgotten the old feel.</br>
So we present to you, our initiative, our very own newspaper right on your terminal.</br></br>
                    `|THE WANDERER|`
</br></br>With a wide range of topics to read from including news sections such as world news, sports news, science, health and many more. <br/></br>You also can see top post of reddit from your terminal.</br>
The best part is... ALL THE NEWS IS IN REALTIME!!</br></br>
We also have crosswords to give you the nostalgia of old times.</br></br>
We have tried to maintain the authenticity of a newspaper with our own little twists so that, it still after all remains like a newspaper of the good old days
## The Idea
Considering the interface to be used as a Text User Interface(TUI) as well as the theme of "THINKING INSIDE THE BOX", creating a newspaper was a no brainer.</br></br>
Since it sticks true to the concept of being completely text based as well as the fact that it technically is in a box, we decided to go ahead with the option of making a newspaper. </br></br>
We also decided to put our own little twist to it by adding a few interactive games as well.
We have also decided to add everyone's favourite..... ADS! Those pesky guys arent going anywhere
either, just to stick to the realism ðŸ˜œ</br>
We have added crossword puzzles as well for the old timers, and those who miss that brainteaser in these modern day online papers.
## Setup
