# Merciful Millipedes

Repository for our submission to Python Discord Summer Code Jam 2021. Theme:- Think Inside the Box

## Description
With the steady decline of the old newspaper on paper and an increasing dependance on online
news and media, we have often forgotten the old feel.

So we present to you, our initiative, our very own newspaper

                    +------------+
                    |THE WANDERER|
                    +------------+

With a wide range of topics to read from including news sections such as world news, sports news, science, health and many more. There is a section for everyone, the one's who want to know what Biden is up to or Putin is doing, the sports fanatics, the tech savvy, the health conscious one's curious about what the latest health trend is. One can even browse for jobs like on any other newspapers.

The best part is... ALL THE NEWS IS IN REALTIME!! Select from any of our topics, and you will recieve live news regarding the topic.

We also have crosswords to give you the nostalgia of old times.

We have tried to maintain the authenticity of a newspaper with our own little twists so that, it still after all remains like a newspaper of the good old days

## The Idea
Considering the interface to be used as a Text User Interface(TUI) as well as the theme of "THINKING INSIDE THE BOX", creating a newspaper was a no brainer.

Since it sticks true to the concept of being completely text based as well as the fact that it technically is in a box, we decided to go ahead with the option of making a newspaper. 

We also decided to put our own little twist to it by adding a few interactive games as well.

We have also decided to add everyone's favourite..... ADS! Those pesky guys arent going anywhere 
either, just to stick to the realism ðŸ˜œ

We have added crossword puzzles as well for the old timers, and those who miss that brainteaser in these modern day online papers.

## Setup
