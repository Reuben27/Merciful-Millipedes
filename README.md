# Merciful Millipedes

Repository for our submission to Python Discord Summer Code Jam 2021. Theme:- Think Inside the Box

## Description
With the steady decline of the old newspaper on paper and an increasing dependance on online
news and media, we have often forgot the old feel.

So we present to you, our intitative, our very own newspaper
                    +------------+
                    |THE WANDERER|
                    +------------+

With a wide range of topics to read from including news sections such as world news, sport news,science, health and many more. One can even browse for jobs like on any other newspaper that we find.

The best part is... ALL OF THE NEWS IS IN REALTIME!! Select from any of our topics, and you will recieve live news regarding the topic.

We also have crosswords to give you the nostalgia of old times.

We have tried to maintain the authenticity of a newspaper with our own little twists so that, it still after all remains like a newspaper of the good old days

## The Idea
Considering the interface to be used as a Text User Interface(TUI) as well as the theme of "THINKING INSIDE THE BOX", what better idea was there than creating a newspaper.

Since it sticks true to the concept of being comepletely text based as well as the fact that it technically is in a box, we decided to go ahead with the option of making a newspaper. 

We also decided to put our own little twist to it by adding a few interactive games as well.

We have also decided to add everyone's favourite..... ADS! Those pesky guys arent going anywhere 
either, just to stick to the realism ðŸ˜œ

For the we have added the old timer crossword puzzles as well for those who miss that in these online papers.
